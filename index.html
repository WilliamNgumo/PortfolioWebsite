                <h3>More <span>about me</span></h3>
                <p>
                    My journey of creating started 8 years ago when I created a Youtube channel. This youtube channel is based off of my gaming skills and showing others
                    how to become better at it. My channel started to grow and I built a fan base of 5,500 subscribers and in the process of that, I learned how to edit 
                    videos, create thumbnails using hit film express, Adobe premiere pro, and adobe photoshop. Once my channel gained 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of 
                    watch time, I was able to monetize my channel using Adsense and earned capital. With learning all of these things, my mind grew eager to learn more. 
                    This led me to start using pre-built Shopify websites to dropship items and create affiliate marketing for gaming products. Once I learned the ropes 
                    of website developing, I started my own company called Success Keys LLC. This company led me to create ecommerce stores for others and allowed me to 
                    help small business companies grow and build an online presence. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With my knowledge in Shopify, I was able to create an eye catching website that drew customers in for my clients. My venture of creating this 
                    business was knowing my market and at the time there was a covid pandemic that led to a worldwide lockdown. While building this business, I was 
                    also in the process of finishing high school and after school I dedicated my time to learning more on website designing and researching business 
                    that did not have an online platform. I’ve worked with numerous businesses but here's a few;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Orange Beauty & More, 5 Star Fashion and Jewelry, Mike Jewelers, QuenchSTL, and DripNation STL. As you can see, I’ve worked with broad 
                    and different ranges of business models. Once I started creating websites, I learned more about other website builder sites such as Elementor, 
                    Woo commerce, Php, Wix, GoDaddy builder, and more. Afterwards, I gained a bit of knowledge on css to make each one of my clients' websites unique. 
                    Fast forwarding to the year of 2024, I attended Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development Program and learned to develop while learning front end and 
                    back end. I, now, have the confidence to say that I would like to join an innovative team and help create amazing projects while bringing companies 
                    or customers ideas to life.

                Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, I’ve gained a solid foundation in modern web development and enhanced my technical expertise. With a background in website 
                design and management through my business, SuccessKeysAgency, I’ve helped local businesses establish their online presence. I’ve also honed my technical skills through personal projects, 
                like building single-page applications (SPAs) for multi-menu restaurant systems. My journey began as a content creator and professional gamer, where I developed expertise in video editing,
                 project planning, and creative problem-solving. Combining creativity with technical proficiency,
                 I’m dedicated to building seamless, user-friendly applications and continuously learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p> -->
